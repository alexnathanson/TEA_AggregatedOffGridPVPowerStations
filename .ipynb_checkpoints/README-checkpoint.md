## Abstract
In order to successfully transition from the fossil fuel powered electrical grid to a renewably powered grid, it is imperative to expand deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) and enable demand side management of electrical grids through demand response (DR) programs. Residential access to both DERs and DR is primarily available to single-family home owners, excluding renters and people who live in multifamily apartment buildings. Over a third of the US population is a renter and in cities the percentage of renters can more than double. This study aims to add to the limited body of research on energy transition interventions for renters in large cities by modeling the energy and economic performance of small-scale off-grid PV and battery systems designed for them. New York City (NYC) was chosen as a case study. A database of commercially available hardware was created and an analysis of the DR network characteristics and history of DR events in NYC was conducted. A software model to simulate the impact of all the key variables on energy yield and automated DR performance was developed. Financial benefits were calculated based on the end-user's automated performance in DR programs and avoided grid electricity costs. The results of the study confirm that, when designed based on DR network characteristics, small-scale off-grid systems can be considered financially viable in urban contexts. In some contexts, these types of systems can perform in DR events at similar levels as smart thermostats and have ROIs that compare favorably with other DER technologies. This affirms that these types of interventions can expand access for people whose living situations preclude them from utilizing other types of DER technologies.
